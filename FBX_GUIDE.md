# ðŸš€ FBX Workflow - Quick Start

## What Changed?

**Before:** Upload UV sheet â†’ Paint masks â†’ Select components manually
**Now:** Upload FBX with parts â†’ Click parts â†’ Add textures directly!

## How to Use

### 1. **Load your FBX file** ðŸŽ®
```
Click: "Load Model (.obj/.fbx)" â†’ Select your AK47_PARTS.fbx
```

The app will automatically detect all parts:
- Body
- Magazine
- Handle
- Trigger
- etc.

### 2. **Enable Interactive Mode** ðŸŽ¨
```
Click: "Interactive Mode" button
```

Now you can:
- **Hover** over 3D model â†’ See part name
- **Click** a part â†’ Select it (turns green)

### 3. **Add Images to Selected Part** âž•
```
Click: "Add Image" â†’ Upload your texture
```

The texture applies **ONLY** to the selected part!

### 4. **Repeat & Export** ðŸ’¾
```
Select another part â†’ Add more images â†’ Click "Export"
```

## Example Workflow

```
1. Load: AK47_PARTS.fbx
   âœ“ Found 12 parts!

2. Click "Interactive Mode"
   âœ“ Interactive mode ON

3. Click the BODY in 3D viewer
   âœ“ Selected: Body

4. Click "Add Image" â†’ Upload skull.png
   âœ“ Skull applied to body only!

5. Click the MAGAZINE in 3D viewer
   âœ“ Selected: Magazine

6. Click "Add Image" â†’ Upload camo.jpg
   âœ“ Camo applied to magazine only!

7. Click "Export" â†’ Save final texture
   âœ“ Done!
```

## Benefits

âœ… **No UV sheet painting** - Just click parts!
âœ… **No mask creation** - Parts are already separated!
âœ… **Super simple** - 3 clicks per texture!
âœ… **Fast** - No island detection needed!

## Tips

- Your FBX should have **named parts** (e.g., "Body", "Magazine")
- Each part should be a **separate mesh**
- Works best with **clean topology** (not millions of faces)
- You can still use OBJ files with the old workflow if needed

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see part names?**
A: Your FBX parts might be unnamed. Use Blender to rename them.

**Q: I accidentally selected wrong part?**
A: Click "Clear Selection" in the green box.

**Q: Can I select multiple parts?**
A: Not yet - but you can apply the same texture to each part one by one!
