# Island Selection Mode - UV Component Selection

## What Changed

### Before:
- ‚ùå Clicking on the handle selected only a single triangle face
- ‚ùå Saw thousands of internal lines on UV map
- ‚ùå Had to manually select each tiny face

### After:
- ‚úÖ Clicking on the handle selects the **ENTIRE handle component**
- ‚úÖ Clean outlines show component boundaries (no internal lines)
- ‚úÖ One click = entire UV island selected

## How It Works

### UV Island Detection
When you load a model, the app now:

1. **Parses the OBJ file** - extracts vertices, UVs, faces
2. **Detects UV Islands** - groups connected faces into components
3. **Builds edge maps** - identifies which edges are boundaries

**UV Island** = A group of connected UV faces (e.g., all faces that make up the gun handle)

### Component Selection
When you click on the 3D model:

1. **Raycast** detects which triangle face you clicked
2. **Island lookup** finds which UV island contains that face
3. **Entire island** is highlighted with clean outlines
4. **Mask created** from all faces in that island

## Visual Difference

### Old Behavior (Single Face):
```
Click handle ‚Üí Highlights 1 tiny triangle
UV shows: Mesh of thousands of lines
Result: Need to click 500+ times to select handle
```

### New Behavior (Island Selection):
```
Click handle ‚Üí Highlights ENTIRE HANDLE
UV shows: Clean outline of handle shape
Result: One click = entire component selected!
```

## UI Changes

### Interactive Controls Panel:
**New text:**
- "Interactive Component Selection"
- "Click to select entire component (handle, body, magazine, etc.)"
- "Selected area will be highlighted with clean outlines"
- "Mode: Island Selection (Full Components)"

### Hover Behavior:
- **Cyan outline** shows component preview when hovering
- **Green fill + outline** shows selected component when clicked

### UV Wireframe Button:
- Shows clean component outlines only
- No internal triangle edges
- Only boundary edges of UV islands

## Performance Optimizations

### For Large Models (AK-47):
- **Max 100,000 faces** processed for island detection
- Still finds major components (body, handle, magazine, etc.)
- Prevents browser hangs on massive models

### For Small Models (Pistol):
- **All faces** processed
- Perfect island detection
- Every component detected

## Examples

### Pistol Components:
Clicking different parts selects:
- **Slide** (top moving part)
- **Frame** (main body)
- **Grip** (handle)
- **Trigger guard**
- **Magazine**

### AK-47 Components:
Clicking different parts selects:
- **Receiver** (main body)
- **Stock** (shoulder rest)
- **Handguard** (front grip)
- **Magazine**
- **Barrel**
- **Sights**

## How to Use

### Step 1: Load Model
```
1. Click "Load 3D Model"
2. Select your OBJ file
3. Wait for island detection to complete
   Console will show: "Detected X UV islands"
```

### Step 2: Enable Interactive Mode
```
1. Click "üé® Interactive Mode: OFF" button
2. It turns green: "üé® Interactive Mode: ON"
3. UV wireframe appears showing component outlines
```

### Step 3: Select Components
```
1. Hover over 3D model parts
   ‚Üí See cyan preview of component
2. Click on a part (e.g., handle)
   ‚Üí Entire component highlighted in green
   ‚Üí UV map shows clean outline
3. Add images - they will clip to selected component
```

### Step 4: Paint Selected Area
```
1. Click "Add Image Layer"
2. Select your texture/design
3. Image appears on UV canvas
4. Move/scale/rotate image
5. Image only appears on selected component!
```

## Technical Details

### Island Detection Algorithm:
```javascript
1. Build edge map: Map each UV edge to faces that use it
2. Find boundaries: Edges used by exactly 1 face = boundaries
3. Group faces: Connected faces = UV island
4. Result: List of islands with their face indices
```

### Highlighting Algorithm:
```javascript
1. Fill island area with semi-transparent color
2. Find boundary edges (edges shared by only 1 face)
3. Draw thick outline around boundaries
4. Result: Clean shape with visible outline
```

### Performance Limits:
| Model Size | Island Detection | Result |
|------------|------------------|--------|
| <50k faces | Full processing | Perfect |
| 50k-100k   | Full processing | Excellent |
| >100k      | Limited to 100k | Good (main components) |
| >200k      | Interactive mode disabled | View only |

## Comparison: Old vs New

### Old System (Face Selection):
```
Advantage: None really
Disadvantages:
- Had to click hundreds of times
- Couldn't see component shapes
- UV map was cluttered mess
- Selecting handle = 30 minutes of clicking
```

### New System (Island Selection):
```
Advantages:
- One click = entire component
- Clean visual outlines
- Fast and intuitive
- Professional workflow
Disadvantages:
- Requires island detection (adds 1-3 seconds load time)
- Limited to 100k faces on huge models
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Island not found" error:
**Cause:** Face has no UV coordinates or is not connected
**Solution:** Check if model has proper UV unwrapping

### Components not selecting properly:
**Cause:** Model might have disconnected UVs
**Solution:** Re-unwrap UVs in Blender with proper seams

### Selection is slow:
**Cause:** Model has >100k faces
**Solution:**
- Use simplified model
- Decimate in Blender
- Interactive mode may be disabled automatically

### Wrong component selected:
**Cause:** UVs might be overlapping or touching
**Solution:** Ensure UV islands have proper spacing in UV editor

## Best Practices

### Creating UV Maps:
1. **Mark seams properly** - defines island boundaries
2. **Unwrap with margin** - keep islands separated
3. **Pack UVs efficiently** - but don't overlap
4. **Test in app** - verify islands select correctly

### Working with Complex Models:
1. **Start with smaller models** to understand system
2. **Use LOD models** for editing (lower polygon count)
3. **Test island selection** before adding textures
4. **Export high-res** when done editing

### Optimal Workflow:
```
1. Load model ‚Üí Wait for island detection
2. Enable interactive mode
3. Click each component once to verify detection
4. Add textures to selected components
5. Export final texture
6. Apply to high-poly model in game
```

## Tips & Tricks

### Multi-Component Selection:
- Currently: One component at a time
- Workaround: Use mask images for multiple components

### Fine Control:
- **Zoom in** on 3D model for precise clicking
- **Rotate model** to access all sides
- **Use UV wireframe** to see component layout

### Faster Texturing:
1. Select handle ‚Üí Add wood texture
2. Select body ‚Üí Add metal texture
3. Select magazine ‚Üí Add plastic texture
4. Done in 3 clicks instead of 3 hours!

## FAQ

**Q: Why do I see lines inside the component?**
A: Those are the UV wireframe. Click "Hide UV Wireframe" to remove them.

**Q: Can I select multiple components at once?**
A: Not yet - one component at a time. Use mask files for multi-component selection.

**Q: The gun handle is still split into many pieces**
A: The model's UVs have multiple islands for one component. Re-unwrap in Blender.

**Q: Interactive mode is disabled for my AK-47**
A: Model has >200k polygons. Use a simplified version for editing.

**Q: How do I know what islands were detected?**
A: Check console log after loading: "Detected X UV islands"

**Q: Can I save selected components?**
A: Use "Export Texture" to save. The mask is applied to exported image.
