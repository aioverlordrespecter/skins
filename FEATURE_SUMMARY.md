# 🎉 CS:GO Skin Editor - Complete Feature Summary

## What You Asked For

> "Is it possible for me to just upload my obj file and the app extract the uv sheets, then i can drag over the obj and it will highlight the associated areas of the uv sheet and then i can apply images to the active parts of the sheet?"

## What We Built

**YES! And even better than requested!** ✨

### The Revolutionary Workflow

```
1. Upload OBJ → UVs extracted automatically
2. Enable Interactive Mode → UV wireframe appears
