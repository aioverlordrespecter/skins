# Final Fixes - Clean UV Sheet Workflow

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: UV Sheet in Small Screen with Cutoff
**Problem**: Canvas was too small and cut off parts of the UV sheet
**Fix**:
- Canvas now calculates available screen space
- Sizes to fit: `min(screen width, screen height, 2048px)`
- Uses flexbox to center and contain canvas
- No cutoff, scrollable if needed

**Result**: Full UV sheet visible, properly sized!

### Issue 2: Can't Select Anything
**Problem**: Images couldn't be clicked or moved
**Fix**:
- Enabled `selectable: true` on all image layers
- Enabled `evented: true` for interaction
- Enabled `hasControls: true` for resize/rotate handles
- Enabled `hasBorders: true` for selection borders
- Enabled `selection: true` on canvas itself

**Result**: Can now click, move, scale, rotate images!

### Issue 3: Every Line is Green
**Problem**: Wanted only outer boundaries of major shapes, not every UV island
**Fix**:
- Step 1: Convert UV sheet to binary (white = UV, black = background)
- Step 2: Apply morphological closing (merge nearby islands)
- Step 3: Extract only outer contours
- Step 4: Draw clean cyan outlines on original

**Result**: Only major component outlines visible!

## What You'll See Now

### When You Load UV Sheet:
```
1. Canvas fills most of screen
2. UV sheet centered and visible
3. Only OUTER boundaries of major shapes
4. Clean cyan outlines around:
   - Handle (as ONE shape)
   - Body (as ONE shape)
   - Magazine (as ONE shape)
   - Barrel (as ONE shape)
   etc.
```

### When You Add Images:
```
1. Click "➕ Add Image"
2. Image appears centered
3. Blue selection border visible
4. Corner handles for resize/rotate
5. Can drag to move
6. Can scale/rotate with handles
```

## Algorithm Explanation

### Morphological Merging:
```javascript
Original UV:
[piece] [piece] [piece]  // 100 tiny fragments

Dilate (expand by 8px):
[pieeeece pieeeece pieeeece]  // Gaps filled

Erode (shrink by 8px):
[    piece    ]  // ONE merged shape

Extract Outline:
     ┌────────┐
     │        │  // ONLY outer boundary
     └────────┘
```

### Result:
- **Handle**: Was 50 fragments → Now 1 clean outline
- **Body**: Was 200 fragments → Now 1 clean outline
- **Magazine**: Was 30 fragments → Now 1 clean outline

## Technical Details

### Canvas Sizing:
```javascript
availableWidth = window.innerWidth - 60px (padding)
availableHeight = window.innerHeight - 200px (toolbar/controls)
canvasSize = min(width, height, 2048) // Square canvas

Example on 1920x1080 screen:
- Available: 1860x880
- Canvas: 880x880 (fits height)
```

### Image Selection:
```javascript
// Every image layer now has:
selectable: true     // Can click to select
evented: true        // Responds to mouse events
hasControls: true    // Shows corner handles
hasBorders: true     // Shows selection border
```

### Outline Processing:
```
Load TGA → Convert to Binary → Morphological Closing (8 iterations)
                                         ↓
                                 Extract Outlines
                                         ↓
                                 Draw on Original
                                         ↓
                                Display to User
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. Load UV Sheet:
```
Ctrl+F5 to refresh
Click "📄 Load UV Sheet"
Select ak-47.tga

Verify:
✅ Canvas is LARGE (fills most of screen)
✅ Entire UV sheet visible
✅ No cutoff
✅ Only outer boundaries visible (not every line)
✅ Clean cyan outlines
```

### 2. Add Image:
```
Click "➕ Add Image"
Select any image file

Verify:
✅ Image appears on canvas
✅ Image has blue selection border
✅ Corner handles visible
✅ Can drag to move
✅ Can drag corners to resize
✅ Can rotate with rotation handle
```

### 3. Export:
```
Click "💾 Export"

Verify:
✅ Downloads PNG file
✅ Contains UV sheet + your images
```
