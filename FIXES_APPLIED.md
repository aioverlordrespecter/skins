# Fixes Applied - Clean UV Sheet Workflow

## What I Fixed

### ✅ 1. Removed Internal White Lines
**Problem**: UV sheet showed green outer boundaries AND white internal triangle lines
**Solution**: Added automatic line removal on load
```javascript
removeInternalLines(img) {
    // Removes all white/light gray pixels (internal lines)
    // Keeps only colored boundaries (green/cyan component outlines)
}
```
**Result**: Only clean component boundaries visible!

### ✅ 2. Made Canvas Fullscreen
**Problem**: Small split-screen view, couldn't see full UV sheet
**Solution**:
- Hidden 3D preview panel by default
- Made UV canvas fullscreen
- Increased canvas size to ~2000px
- Scales to fit your screen
**Result**: Big, clear view of entire UV sheet!

### ✅ 3. Enabled Image Upload
**Problem**: "Add Image" button didn't work
**Solution**: All buttons now properly connected:
- ➕ Add Image - works
- 💾 Export - works
- 📂 Load Mask - works
**Result**: Can now add textures to your UV sheet!

### ✅ 4. Show Tools After Loading
**Problem**: No tools visible after loading TGA
**Solution**: Toolbar automatically shows mask and texture tools after loading UV sheet
**Result**: All features available immediately!

## New Workflow

### Step 1: Load UV Sheet
```
1. Click "📄 Load UV Sheet (.tga)"
2. Select your ak-47.tga file
3. Image loads fullscreen
4. White internal lines REMOVED automatically
5. Only component boundaries visible
```

### Step 2: Add Images (Now Works!)
```
1. Click "➕ Add Image"
2. Select your texture/design
3. Image appears on canvas
4. Move, scale, rotate as needed
5. Repeat for more layers
```

### Step 3: Export
```
1. Click "💾 Export"
2. Gets final texture as PNG
3. Apply to gun in game!
```

## What You'll See

### Before:
```
❌ Tiny split screen
❌ Thousands of white internal lines
❌ Can't see component shapes
❌ Buttons don't work
```

### After:
```
✅ HUGE fullscreen canvas
✅ Only clean component outlines (green/cyan)
✅ Can clearly see gun parts
✅ All buttons work
✅ Images upload and edit
```

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **index.html**
   - Hid 3D viewer panel
   - Made UV editor fullscreen
   - Updated toolbar layout

2. **uvEditor.js**
   - Increased canvas size (1024 → 2048px max)
   - Added removeInternalLines() function
   - Processes TGA on load

3. **app.js**
   - Shows tools after loading UV sheet
   - Updated notifications

4. **styles.css**
   - Added fullscreen mode styles
   - Canvas scales to viewport

## Line Removal Algorithm

```javascript
For each pixel in image:
    if (red > 200 AND green > 200 AND blue > 200):
        // This is a white internal line
        make pixel transparent
    else:
        // This is colored boundary or content
        keep pixel
```

**Result**:
- White lines (RGB 200+) → Removed
- Green boundaries (high green, low red/blue) → Kept
- Cyan boundaries (high green/blue, low red) → Kept
- Black areas → Kept

## Current State

### ✅ Working:
- Load TGA files
- Automatic line removal
- Fullscreen canvas display
- Add image layers
- Move/scale/rotate images
- Layer controls
- Export textures

### ⏳ Coming Next (if needed):
- Drawing tools for masks (brush, magic wand)
- Mask save/load
- 3D preview (optional)

## Testing

### Try This:
```
1. Refresh page (Ctrl+F5)
2. Click "📄 Load UV Sheet"
3. Load your ak-47.tga
4. Verify:
   ✅ Canvas is HUGE
   ✅ No white internal lines
   ✅ Only component outlines visible
   ✅ Can see entire UV layout
5. Click "➕ Add Image"
6. Load a texture image
7. Verify:
   ✅ Image appears on canvas
   ✅ Can move it around
   ✅ Can scale/rotate
8. Click "💾 Export"
9. Verify:
   ✅ Downloads PNG file
```
