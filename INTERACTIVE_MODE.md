# Interactive UV Selection Mode - User Guide

## Overview

Interactive Mode is a revolutionary feature that lets you **select UV regions by clicking directly on the 3D model**. No more manual mask creation - just point, click, and paint!

## How It Works

### The Magic ‚ú®

1. **Load your OBJ file** ‚Üí App automatically extracts UV coordinates
2. **Click "Interactive Mode"** ‚Üí UV wireframe appears
3. **Hover over 3D model** ‚Üí UV regions highlight in real-time
4. **Click to select** ‚Üí Selected region becomes an automatic mask
5. **Add images** ‚Üí They only appear in the selected area!

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Load Your Model

```
1. Click "Load 3D Model (.obj)"
2. Select your weapon model
3. Wait for the app to extract UV data
4. You'll see: "Model loaded successfully! Click 'Interactive Mode' to start."
```

The app automatically:
- Parses all UV coordinates from the OBJ file
- Detects UV islands (connected regions)
- Creates an interactive UV wireframe
- Prepares face-picking system

#### Step 2: Enable Interactive Mode

```
1. Click "üé® Interactive Mode: OFF" button
2. Button turns cyan and pulses
3. UV wireframe appears on the canvas
4. Interactive controls panel opens
```

Now you're ready to select!

#### Step 3: Select UV Regions

**Two Selection Modes:**

**A) UV Island Mode (Recommended)**
- Hover over model ‚Üí Entire connected region highlights (cyan)
- Click ‚Üí Full island selected (green)
- Perfect for: Body parts, magazines, stocks, etc.

**B) Single Face Mode**
- Hover over model ‚Üí Individual triangle highlights
- Click ‚Üí Only that triangle selected
- Perfect for: Precise detail work

#### Step 4: Add Images

```
1. Click "Add Image Layer"
2. Select your image
3. **Magic!** Image automatically clips to selected region
4. Position and scale as normal
5. Image won't bleed into other areas!
```

#### Step 5: Select Different Regions

```
1. Click another part of the 3D model
2. Previous selection clears
3. New region highlights and becomes active
4. Add more images - they'll go to the new region
```

## Features

### Real-Time UV Preview

- **Hover highlighting**: See UV regions as you move your mouse
- **UV wireframe overlay**: Shows the entire UV layout
- **Color-coded selection**: 
  - Cyan = Hovering
  - Green = Selected
  - Transparent = Inactive

### UV Island Detection

The app intelligently groups connected UV faces into "islands":

```
Example: AK-47
- Body/Receiver: 1 island
- Magazine: 1 island  
- Stock: 1 island
- Barrel: 1 island
- Small parts: Multiple small islands
```

When you click the body, the **entire body island** is selected, not just one triangle!

### Automatic Masking

Selected regions automatically become masks:
- Images placed = clipped to selection
- Move images around = stay within bounds
- Change selection = start fresh with new region

## UI Controls

### Toolbar

**üé® Interactive Mode Button**
- OFF (purple) = Normal editing
- ON (cyan, pulsing) = Interactive selection active

### Interactive Controls Panel

**Selection Mode Dropdown**
- `UV Island` = Select entire connected regions
- `Single Face` = Select individual triangles

**Show UV Wireframe Button**
- Toggle UV overlay on/off
- Useful for seeing the full UV layout

### Visual Feedback

**3D Viewer**
- Cursor changes to pointer over faces
- Can still rotate/zoom with orbit controls
- Click model parts to select regions

**UV Canvas**
- Cyan highlight = Hovering
- Green overlay = Selected and active
- Semi-transparent = See your work underneath

## Tips & Tricks

### Best Practices

**For Beginners:**
1. Always use "UV Island" mode
2. Load a base texture first to see the gun
3. Enable UV wireframe to understand layout
4. Click once, add multiple images to same region
5. Click again to switch to different part

**For Advanced Users:**
1. Use "Single Face" for precise details
2. Shift+click to add faces to selection (future feature)
3. Combine with regular masking for complex designs
4. Export selection as reusable mask

### Workflow Example

**Creating a Custom AK-47 Skin:**

```
1. Load weapon_rif_ak47.obj
   ‚Üí UV data extracted automatically

2. Click "Interactive Mode: OFF"
   ‚Üí Becomes "Interactive Mode: ON"
   ‚Üí UV wireframe appears

3. Hover over body in 3D view
   ‚Üí Body UV island highlights (cyan)

4. Click body
   ‚Üí Body selected (green highlight)
   ‚Üí "Selected UV island with 2547 faces"

5. Add dragon_pattern.png
   ‚Üí Automatically clipped to body only
   ‚Üí Dragon appears on body, not magazine/stock!

6. Click magazine in 3D view
   ‚Üí Magazine UV island selected
   ‚Üí Body selection cleared

7. Add skull_logo.png
   ‚Üí Clipped to magazine only
   ‚Üí Works independently from body

8. Click stock
   ‚Üí Stock selected

9. Add wood_texture.png
   ‚Üí Clipped to stock

10. Turn off Interactive Mode
    ‚Üí Continue with normal editing
    ‚Üí Or export your masterpiece!
```

### Troubleshooting

**UV wireframe doesn't appear**
- Make sure model has UV coordinates
- Check console for "UV extracted: X UVs, Y islands"
- Try clicking "Show UV Wireframe" manually

**Nothing highlights when hovering**
- Interactive Mode might be OFF
- Model might not be loaded
- Try clicking model instead of empty space

**Selection seems wrong**
- Switch between "Island" and "Face" modes
- Some models have unusual UV layouts
- Check if UVs overlap (common in game models)

**Image doesn't clip correctly**
- Make sure you clicked to SELECT (green), not just hovering (cyan)
- Check "Selected UV island" notification appeared
- Try disabling/re-enabling Interactive Mode

**Performance is slow**
- Large models (>100K faces) take longer
- UV island detection is one-time cost
- Highlighting is real-time and optimized

## Technical Details

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

**On Model Load:**
1. OBJ text is parsed line-by-line
2. Vertex positions (`v`), UV coords (`vt`), and faces (`f`) extracted
3. Faces triangulated if needed (quads ‚Üí triangles)
4. UV adjacency map built
5. Connected components algorithm finds islands
6. UV wireframe canvas generated

**On Hover:**
1. Mouse position converted to 3D ray
2. Ray intersects model geometry (raycasting)
3. Intersection point ‚Üí face index
4. Face index ‚Üí UV indices lookup
5. If Island mode: find island containing face
6. Draw highlight on UV canvas

**On Click:**
1. Selected face(s) stored
2. UV mask canvas generated from face UVs
3. Mask applied to masking system
4. Future images auto-clipped using mask

### Performance Characteristics

- **Model Load**: O(n) where n = faces
- **Island Detection**: O(n + e) where e = edges
- **Raycasting**: O(log n) with BVH
- **Highlighting**: O(f) where f = selected faces
- **Memory**: ~1-2 MB per 10K faces

### Compatibility

**Supported OBJ Features:**
- ‚úÖ Triangular faces (f v1/vt1/vn1 ...)
- ‚úÖ Quad faces (auto-triangulated)
- ‚úÖ N-gon faces (fan triangulated)
- ‚úÖ Multiple UV sets (uses first)
- ‚úÖ Mixed vertex formats
- ‚ùå No UV coordinates = no highlighting

**Browser Requirements:**
- WebGL for raycasting
- Canvas 2D for UV rendering
- ES6 modules for code
- Raycaster API from Three.js

## Advanced Features

### Combination with Manual Masks

You can use both:
1. Interactive Mode for quick region selection
2. Manual mask loading for pre-made templates
3. Switch between them as needed

### Export Selected Region

(Future feature)
- Click to select island
- Export mask as PNG
- Reuse in other projects

### Multi-Region Selection

(Future feature)
- Shift+click to add regions
- Ctrl+click to subtract
- Build complex masks interactively

## Comparison

### Interactive Mode vs Manual Masks

| Feature | Interactive | Manual Mask |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Setup Time | Instant | 5-30 minutes |
| Precision | Perfect | Depends on skill |
| Ease of Use | Click & go | Image editor needed |
| Flexibility | Per-session | Reusable |
| Learning Curve | None | Moderate |

**Recommendation**: Use Interactive Mode for exploration and quick work, create manual masks for repeated projects.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I still need manual masks?**
A: No! Interactive Mode extracts UVs from the OBJ automatically.

**Q: Can I save my selections?**
A: Currently selections are per-session. Export feature coming soon.

**Q: Does it work with all OBJ files?**
A: Works with any OBJ that has UV coordinates (vt lines).

**Q: Is it faster than Photoshop masking?**
A: Much faster! No image editor needed - just click the model.

**Q: Can I select multiple islands at once?**
A: One at a time for now. Multi-select coming in future update.

**Q: What if my model has no UVs?**
A: You'll need to UV unwrap it in Blender/Maya first.

**Q: Does it work with other games' models?**
A: Yes! Any OBJ with UVs works (Valorant, Fortnite, etc.).
